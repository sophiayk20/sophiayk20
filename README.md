  * :seedling: <b>[Summer 2023]</b> Iâ€™m currently learning TTS (Text-to-Speech) models through an internship. It's very exciting to find out how the generative AI models I encountered in a Spring 2023 course (CPSC 482) work with the devices/technology we use everyday. I have also discovered a new interest in studying large language models, which I hope to explore in the upcoming year!
  
  * :books: I enjoy helping out with computer science education initiatives at Yale. I have been a part of <i>Code Haven</i>, which teaches New Haven middle school students how to code, and have also been TAing for courses such as <i>CS50</i> (Intro to Computing & Programming) and <i>CS223</i> (Data Structures and Programming Techniques).
  * :computer: In my free time, you can find me studying human or nonhuman languages. I have recently been studying corpus text input into Tacotron models and have been focusing on how Spanish accents are reflected in phoneme representations..!
